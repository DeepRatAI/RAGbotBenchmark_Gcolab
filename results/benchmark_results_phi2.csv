What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning that each input has a corresponding output or target value. The algorithm learns to map the inputs to the outputs and can then make predictions on new inputs. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, meaning that there is no output or target value for each input. The algorithm learns to find patterns, clusters, or structures in the data and can then","Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data.",2.9,0.8860082030296326,0.1923076923076923,Phi-2,Tesla T4,
Explain the concept of overfitting in machine learning.,"Overfitting is a problem in machine learning when a model learns too much from the training data and fails to generalize well to new data. This means that the model performs well on the training data, but poorly on the test or validation data. Overfitting can occur when the model is too complex, has too many features, or is not regularized. Overfitting can reduce the accuracy and reliability of the model and make it less useful for real-world applications.","Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, resulting in poor generalization to new data.",2.7,0.9118677973747253,0.24,Phi-2,Tesla T4,
What is the purpose of regularization in neural networks?,Regularization is used to prevent overfitting in neural networks.,"Regularization prevents overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, discouraging complex models.",0.43,0.9195498824119568,0.17391304347826086,Phi-2,Tesla T4,
How does the gradient descent algorithm work?,"The gradient descent algorithm is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It works by iteratively adjusting the parameters of the function in the direction of the steepest descent of the function. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameters and then updates them based on the gradient of the function. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function. By moving in the opposite direction of the gradient, the algorithm converges to the minimum of the",Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that updates model parameters by minimizing the loss function using gradients.,2.83,0.868304431438446,0.16666666666666669,Phi-2,Tesla T4,
What is a confusion matrix and how is it used?,"A confusion matrix is a table that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class. It is used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.","A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes classification results, showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.",1.86,0.9211229085922241,0.49275362318840576,Phi-2,Tesla T4,
